### How to run this project?

 - clone this repository, and in your terminal firstly run `npm install`
 - then run `npm run dev`
 - everything is implemented as requested but I didn't get the last point:
   - Have the frontend call the REST API for saving every five seconds (not every action).
     Display a loading spinner whenever it is saving, and how long has passed since the last
     save. Avoid saving if no changes have been made.
   - If i save it then api will be called eventually, but every 5 seconds? Please clarify on this.
